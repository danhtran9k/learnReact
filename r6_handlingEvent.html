DESCRIPTION

Handling events with React elements is very similar to handling events on DOM elements. There are some syntax differences:

React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase.
With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.

Another difference is that you cannot return false to prevent default behavior in React. You must call preventDefault explicitly. 

e is a synthetic even
https://reactjs.org/docs/events.html

When using React, you generally don’t need to call addEventListener to add listeners to a DOM element after it is created. Instead, just provide a listener when the element is initially rendered.

You have to be careful about the meaning of this in JSX callbacks. In JavaScript, class methods are not bound by default. If you forget to bind this.handleClick and pass it to onClick, this will be undefined when the function is actually called.

This is not React-specific behavior; it is a part of how functions work in JavaScript. Generally, if you refer to a method without () after it, such as onClick={this.handleClick}, you should bind that method.

-> có 2 cách fix đề cập trong link:
    1 dùng experiment syntax
    2 dùng arrow func -> có drawback, đọc trong link, 
    tuy nhiên nếu ko truyền prop cho con thì vẫn ok
